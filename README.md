<ul><li>A digital stopwatch game where the player scores points for stopping a timer on a whole second. I built this simple app using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript (Click <a href="https://github.com/kyleyasumiishi/Fundamentals_of_Computing/blob/master/IIPP/stopwatch.py" target="_blank">here</a> for my Python implementation). This app works great on desktop, smartphones, and tablets.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (Click <a href="https://github.com/kyleyasumiishi/Fundamentals_of_Computing/blob/master/IIPP/rice_rocks.py" target="_blank">here</a> for my Python implementation). This game works best on a desktop or laptop monitor as the canvas is 800x600 pixels. The name RiceRocks is a reference to to Rice University, which offers the Coursera specialization Fundamentals of Computing that features this game as one of its interactive programming projects in Python.
