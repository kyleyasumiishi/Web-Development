# 2048

2048 is a popoular tile-merging game created by Gabriele Cirulli. I built this project in Python as a replica of the original game as part of Rice University's Coursera specialization <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Computing</a>. Later, I recreated it in JavaScript as I began learning web development.
