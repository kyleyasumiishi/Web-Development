        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to discuss the programming skills and computer science concepts I learned from taking the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals">Fundamentals of Computing specialization on Coursera</a> over the past year.</p> 

        <p>The Fundamentals of Computing specialization consists of seven courses offered by Rice University. It uses the Python programming language to teach fundamental programming skills and computer science concepts that first-year CS students learn at Rice University.</p>
        
        <p>Taking this specialization was my first introduction to programming, aside from a very introductory course I took 10 years ago in high school on HTML. I wrote all of these posts after completing the entire specialization primarily to serve as a useful reference for myself in the future, but also to showcase the wide range of interesting projects I built.</p> 
        
        <p>I built most of these projects in <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/">CodeSkulptor</a>, an online Python environment built by Scott Rixner, a CS professor at Rice University and one of the creators of this specialization. It wasn't until I took the two Algorithmic Thinking courses of the specialization that I started using VS Code as my primary development environment. I used Python 2.7 for all of these projects.</p> 
        
        <p>I highly recommend the Fundamentals of Computing specialization to anybody who wants a serious, challenging, and extremely fun introduction to programming. When I decided to teach myself Python, I considered other courses on Coursera that have a much shorter time commitment. However, I'm incredibly glad I listened to my gut and chose Rice University's specialization, which takes on average 6-9 months to complete. Although it took me nearly a year to complete all of the courses while working full-time, I feel like I learned a ton not only about Python, but about programming and computer science in general. In fact, this specialization inspired me to pursue a new career in software development!</p>

        <p>The material in this specializaton is broken out into three two-course sections of increasing complexity.</p>
