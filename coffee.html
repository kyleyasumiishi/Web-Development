        <h2>What is coffee?</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed with roasted coffee beans. It has a dark color and earthy aroma. Coffee is one of the world's most popular drinks, and humans have been drinking coffee for over a thousand years. Legend has it that an Ethiopian goat herder accidentally discovered the coffee bean one day when he observed his goats were acting unusually hyper. He noticed they were snacking on a strange-looking bean resembling a cherry. He too ate some of these strange beans, and began dancing with his goats. As this goat herder would attest, coffee is most often consumed for its main pyschoactive ingredient, <a href="https://www.caffeineinformer.com/">caffeine</a>. </p>

        <h2>Sweet, sweet (and not so sweet) effects</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <u>Pros</u>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Focus:</b> This may be a placebo effect, because consuming caffeine actually 
                  decreases the blood flow (and thus oxygen) delivered to your brain, so your brain 
                  on caffeine is not operating at your its capacity. Caffeine can also make your 
                  thoughts sporadic, which can be great for creativity or brainstorming, 
                  but distracting otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Motivation:</b> Coffee is literally the sole motivation 
                  for some people to get out of bed in the morning, myself included.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mood Enhancer:</b> Caffeine increases the levels of your 
                  feel-good hormones, most notably dopamine. Drinking several 
                  cups of coffee can provide quite a pleasant buzz.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Alertness:</b> Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in your brain. 
                  Adenosine is a hormone responsible for promoting sleepiness. 
                  Thus, drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages keeps you feeling alert longer, 
                  but beware - the adenosine doesn't automatically go away, so you'll crash at some point.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Creativity:</b> Drinking coffee may help boost your creativity, 
                  as caffeine's psychoactive properties can alter your perception and 
                  change the way you think about things. Many famous artists and geniuses were huge coffee drinkers, 
                  including Voltaire, Beethoven, and Benjamin Franklin. 
                </li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <u>Cons</u>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Insomnia:</b> Caffeine has a half life of about six hours, meaning it takes roughly six hours for your body to metabolize half of the caffeine content in your bloodstream. Thus, if you drink a delicious Grande Starbucks Pike Place at 3 p.m., about half of the 330 mg of caffeine, or 165 mg, will still be in your system come 9 p.m. Say goodbye to shut eye.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Anxiety:</b> As anybody who's drinken one too many cups of Joe can attest, consuming too much coffee or any caffeinated beverage can cause jitteriness and anxiety.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Addiction:</b> Caffeine is an incredibly powerful and addictive drug, and overcoming a caffeine addiction is no easy feat. In fact, caffeine withdrawal is officially recognized as a legitimate mental disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5. Withdrawal symptoms can vary from person to person, but frequently include a terrible headache, irritability, sleepiness (partially from the accumulation of adenosine), depression, and generally a lack of all the pros listed here. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Coffee Breath:</b> While coffee itself smells blissful, the smell and taste of coffee can linger in your mouth and mix with bacteria and saliva, producing a rather unpleasant smell. Make sure to bring a pack of gum with you next time you visit your local coffee shop!
